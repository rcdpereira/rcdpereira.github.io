title: Learning C++

Keeping on with the adventure, let's learn C++!

I've decided to pursue C++ from mainly 3 reasons:
1. It works close to hardware, which is important if you are trying to develop process controllers that need a fast response.
2. It's useful for writing cross-platform mobile applications, which is part of the plans for the future.
3. I like complicated stuff.

But for learning C++, the decision was to pursue a different path, that led to another different path.

First, I started with [LearnCpp.com](https://www.learncpp.com/), a site that I found looking for ways to learn C++. The good thing about it is that it seems like a book, but the authors do a great job at keeping the content up to date. So, even with the new release of C++20, they are already updating some contents that can benefit from the evolutions in the language. The way they present the content is well explained, and made much sense to me. Although sometimes they can seem a little biased in some statements, all of that came along with good and plausible explanations.

The good thing about learning from a "book" is that it explains the fundamental stuff. I really miss learning from the fundamentals (inheritance from university days), and sometimes those tons of online courses only put you up to start doing things. This is super useful when you are trying to apply something fast, but if you find a bigger problem down the road, the fundamentals are the things that will help you to keep in the right direction. Fundamentals are the best friends of problem-solvers.

But, as a normal and anxious human being, I want to see the results of what I'm learning, otherwise it only seems a waste of time. This is where it enters the second part: learning how to develop games in Unreal Engine with C++. This seemed an interesting way to keep up with the C++ and having fun, and developing games also has to bring creativity to the table, so everything together is a great exercise.

My option was to take the [Unreal Engine C++ Developer: Learn C++ and Make Video Games](https://www.udemy.com/course/unrealcourse/) from the [GameDev.tv](https://www.gamedev.tv/) on Udemy. It's still in the beginning phase, but the lectures so far were well explained. Again, the same thing happended: they explained the basic stuff of C++ in the first section of the course, enough for someone that doesn't know anything about the language to start doing something. The way to introduce that was by supporting the creation of a TripleX game. But it was that. Just the things you have to use, without the fundamentals approach.

Again, there is no problem with that. Anyone who followed the videos could end up with thir version of the game wven withour prior C++ knowledge. But it felt good to understand exactly everything the instructor was doing. Every bit of code he used, I knew what it did. The feeling was amazing, even though it's a very simple program. So, this was the payoff of those days reading a C++ book and just playing with some basic commands to understand the power. This time, something was created: a game which I've played several times, which my wife has played as well. A game that I was bold enough to enhance a little bit to bring more functionalities than what was required. This was only possible because I've dedicated some time for the fundamentals, for sure. I felt comfortable to code in C++!

So, today was a great day in the journey. It's the first time I've coded a game, I'm proud of my accomplishment, and eager to do more.

In the future, these fundamentals will serve me well to develop softwares for Chemical Engineering, which is my main purpose. When this phase starts, the problems will have their natural difficulty, so the coding has to help, and not become another problem to solve. The fundamentals will allow me not to dwell in basic stuff and focus on the real problem to be solved. One step at a time, we keep going.

There's the link for my game, if you want to try it. But watch out, it can explode you!

And I like to say thanks to the GameDev.tv team, for Alex, the mastermind behind LearnCpp.com. I sure found some people who are willing to teach and are making a great job! Thank you!
