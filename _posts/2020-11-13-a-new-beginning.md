title: A New Beginning

After the ferocious year of 2020, forever marked in history, I could only leave with the most certainty in life: nothing is certain! But even with most of the plans for the year being killed by Covid-19, several doors opened for the unexplored paths that got me chills just to think about.

It was a year of discovery, where I could rediscover a passion that was quiet inside me for a long time. And I've decided to let it talk.

In 2014 I graduated as a Chemical Engineer in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and got hired in the company where I was an intern as a Process Engineer. Dreams coming true, yay! After long 7 years in the university, trying to avoid becoming a researcher in a country where research and innovation are not that close to industry (and we are not prepared to have this discussion yet), I only wished to get my hands dirty. So this first work experience fed me with everything my heart desired...at that moment.

After almost 3 years, a new challenge in a company where an engineering department didn't exist: I could create patterns, documents structures, decide which tools we were going to use, etc. My creative side was pumping more than ever, with lots of things to do and accomplish. Everything perfect, right? Never!

Me and the missus decided to embark in our biggest journey: leave our home country to conquer the world! And we did that, but in the middle of the transition came the Oscar winner of the year: I wish it was Joaquin Phoenix, but no, it was the Corona Virus. And it turned the world upside down, ours included.

So what to do now? Simple: say grace because you have people that can support you (love you, cousin!), and be glad to live in the internet era. Just go and embrace what several people are doing - learn a new skill. Cool! New stuff! But what? There are lots of things to learn out there, and we are overwhelmed with information all day long. So my sister-in-law suggested a Data Science Professional Certificate. Lots of programming, new concepts, a way to relate with Chemical Engineering in a practical manner...seemed promising, so I went for that.

After 4 months, certificate ready. Amazing knowledge acquired, a vast ocean to explore and learn from, and yet to learn how to put this together with Chemical Process Engineering. But this is way addressed. The underlying story is the best part. The lots of programming part? Yep, that was the quiet passion I was talking about.

Back as an undergraduate, everytime that I had to use a software with a clear purpose to solve problems, I would go for it. But I was a slow learner, and impatient. If it took too much time and the output wasn't clear enough, I'd just drop it to play bass in my four bands. But one day I had a task where I decided to use Mathcad to solve a Thermodynamics problem, which required a for loop to iterate and get to the answer. After several attempts, nothing seemed to be getting out, so I went to bed - for 10 minutes. These minutes made me remember of a book that could help me, so I opened it, got back to the computer and started to work on several examples from it.

I started at 10 pm, and after LEARNING how to do it, I got back to the problem and solved it in 10 minutes. Another 30 more to run several times, change the values, and still getting the expected answers. I looked at the clock: 6 am in the morning. I had spend the night studying, learning new methods to apply in solving chemical engineering problems, and using programming concepts. And the time didn't matter, I forgot to look at the clock. Then I slept for 2 hours and went to deliver the work at 10 am. Mission accomplished, now I can go play the bass.

Now, in these four months, learning Python and SQL, I started to get in contact with that again. I remembered a VBA based tool I've developed in my last job, and how I enjoyed doing it (more than starting up a plant). I discussed problems with my wife and helped to create the solutions with programming.

I've watched a webinar with professor [Rafiqul Gani](https://www.aiche.org/community/bio/rafiqul-gani) from [PSE for SPEED](https://https://www.pseforspeed.com/) that reminded me the chemical process industry relies so much in the development of new tools that will allow for the design of better processes, more efficient, more sustainable, more precise and less costly. I also started to follow closely the work of Mr. [Daniel Medeiros](https://github.com/DanWBR), a brazilian chemical engineer who developed [DWSim](https://dwsim.inforside.com.br/new/), an open source process simulator that puts up a fight with the big ones.

These people, and the Rodolpho that was studying Thermodynamics in school, inspired me to pursue a path of developing solutions for chemical process and plant design. This will bring my current experience with process engineering to practice, adding up programming and Process Systems Engineering to find new solutions that will help shape the future of the Chemical Process Industry.

This is my new beginning, this is where I'm starting, and this space will be used to talk about this path and where it will take me.
